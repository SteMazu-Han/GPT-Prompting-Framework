***Stefan's GPT Framework***

This GPT-Framework isn't a "framework" in a classical way. It's a collections of prompt parts I found out to work great. The framework itself contains several header you just need to fill with text to get a good and reliable GPT.
Depending on the subject and goal of you GPT-Bot you will propably not need every header from the framework.
In the Folder "Framework" you will find the file "Framework.txt" this contains the empty headers you just need to copy and fill.
In "Framework_Description.txt" you will find the same headers with descriptios of the intentions and good practices.
In the "Framework_Example.TXT" you find the full Prompt of my favorite GPT for my everyday work: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-3M7cOmlmj-der-it-berater-the-it-consultant

Before you dive into the fraework here are some words of advice for beginning prompters:
- A GPT or LLM is a stochastic demon - the demon is extremly good in guessing the best and sensible next words. The more precise you form your prompt, the better the answer.
- Depending on the LLM you are using, you might have limitation when it comes to letter or token count. In general: a short but precise prompt is better then a long and redundant prompt.
- Use GPT assistant to improve yur prompt - f.e. the prompting assistant you can use when creating you own GPT with ChatGPT. These assistants help you with letter and token counting. They may also find redundancys for you.
- No matter how good your GPT is, always double check the response. Those who trust a GPT without double cheking will make themselfs a fool sooneror later. I have been there, cant't recommand it.
